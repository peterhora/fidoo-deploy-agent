# Deploy Skill

You are orchestrating deployments to Azure. Static apps go to Azure Static Web Apps. Fullstack apps (any runtime + optional SQLite) go to Azure Container Apps.
Apps get custom domains under `*.env.fidoo.cloud` and Entra ID authentication.

## Step 1: Check Authentication

Before any operation, check if the user is authenticated:

1. Call `auth_status` (no arguments)
2. If `status` is `"authenticated"` — proceed to the requested operation
3. If `status` is `"not_authenticated"` or `"expired"` — run the login flow:
   a. Call `auth_login` — returns `verification_uri` and `user_code`
   b. Tell the user: **"Open {verification_uri} and enter code {user_code}"**
   c. Wait for the user to confirm they completed the login
   d. Call `auth_poll` with the `device_code` from step (a)
   e. Verify the response shows `status: "authenticated"`

## Step 2: Determine the Operation

Based on the user's request:

| User intent | Operation |
|---|---|
| "deploy", "publish", "put online" | **Deploy** (see Step 3) |
| "delete", "remove", "take down" | **Delete** (see Step 4) |
| "list", "show apps", "what's deployed" | **List** (see Step 5) |
| "info", "status", "details" about a specific app | **Info** (see Step 6) |
| "rename", "update description", "change name" | **Update info** (see Step 7) |
| "rebuild dashboard", "fix dashboard" | **Dashboard rebuild** (see Step 8) |

## Step 3: Deploy

### Detect first deploy vs re-deploy

Check if the target folder contains a `.deploy.json` file.

- **Has `.deploy.json`** → This is a **re-deploy**. The tool reads it automatically.
- **No `.deploy.json`** → This is a **first deploy**. You need `app_name` and `app_description`.

### First deploy

1. Ask the user for an **app name** (human-readable, e.g. "Budget Tracker") and a **short description** if they haven't provided them
2. Call `app_deploy` with:
   - `folder`: absolute path to the app folder
   - `app_name`: the display name
   - `app_description`: short description for the dashboard
3. The tool handles everything: slug generation, collision check, SWA creation, ZIP upload, DNS, auth config, `.deploy.json`, and dashboard rebuild
4. Report the URL: `https://{slug}.env.fidoo.cloud`

## App Type Detection

Before calling any deploy tool, analyze the project folder:

### ⛔ Unsupported database check — do this first

If the project uses any database **other than SQLite**, stop immediately and tell the user:

> "This deploy plugin only supports **SQLite** as a database. Your app appears to use **{detected db}**, which is not supported. To deploy with this plugin, you'll need to rewrite the data layer to use SQLite instead. I can help you do that."

**Unsupported database signals:**

| Signal | Database |
|---|---|
| `pg`, `postgres`, `pg-promise`, `@prisma/client` with `provider = "postgresql"` | PostgreSQL |
| `mysql`, `mysql2`, `@prisma/client` with `provider = "mysql"` | MySQL |
| `mongodb`, `mongoose`, `@prisma/client` with `provider = "mongodb"` | MongoDB |
| `redis`, `ioredis` | Redis |
| `@google-cloud/firestore`, `firebase-admin` | Firestore |
| `mssql`, `tedious` | SQL Server |
| `cassandra-driver` | Cassandra |
| `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` starting with `postgres://`, `mysql://`, `mongodb://` | External DB |

Do NOT proceed to deploy. Offer to help rewrite the app to SQLite.

---

**SQLite signals** (any of these counts):
- `require("node:sqlite")` or `from "node:sqlite"` in any JS/TS file
- `better-sqlite3`, `sqlite3`, `sqlite`, `typeorm`, `prisma`, or `sequelize` in `package.json`
- `SQLAlchemy`, `peewee`, `tortoise-orm`, or `databases` in `requirements.txt`
- Any `.db` or `.sqlite` file at the project root

| Dockerfile? | SQLite signals? | Action |
|---|---|---|
| No | No | `index.html` at root → `app_deploy` (static) |
| No | Yes | → **scaffold deployment files first**, then `container_deploy persistent_storage: true` |
| No | No, but has `package.json` / `requirements.txt` / backend code | → **scaffold deployment files** (no Litestream), then `container_deploy persistent_storage: false` |
| Yes | No | → `container_deploy persistent_storage: false` |
| Yes | Yes | → `container_deploy persistent_storage: true` |

Always confirm with the user before deploying:
- Static: "I'll deploy this as a **static app**. Correct?"
- Container: "I'll deploy this as a **container app**. Correct?"
- Fullstack + storage: "I'll deploy this as a **fullstack container with persistent storage** — SQLite detected. Correct?"

## Scaffold Deployment Files

When there is no Dockerfile, generate it before deploying. Write the files directly into the project folder. Show the user what you generated and confirm before deploying.

### Detect runtime

- Has `package.json` → **Node.js**
- Has `requirements.txt` → **Python**
- Has `.py` files but no `requirements.txt` → **Python** (create a minimal `requirements.txt`)
- Unknown → ask the user

### Detect start command (Node.js)

Check `package.json` `scripts.start` field. If missing, look for `server.js`, `index.js`, `app.js` in that order. Default: `node server.js`.

### Detect start command (Python)

Look for `app.py`, `server.py`, `main.py` in that order. Default: `python app.py`.

### File: `Dockerfile` — Node.js, no SQLite

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "<start-file>"]
```

### File: `Dockerfile` — Node.js, with SQLite (Litestream)

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-slim
ADD https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/releases/download/v0.3.13/litestream-v0.3.13-linux-amd64.tar.gz /tmp/litestream.tar.gz
RUN tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf /tmp/litestream.tar.gz && rm /tmp/litestream.tar.gz
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev
COPY . .
COPY litestream.yml /etc/litestream.yml
COPY start.sh ./
RUN chmod +x start.sh
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./start.sh"]
```

### File: `Dockerfile` — Python, no SQLite

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["python", "<start-file>"]
```

### File: `Dockerfile` — Python, with SQLite (Litestream)

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
ADD https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/releases/download/v0.3.13/litestream-v0.3.13-linux-amd64.tar.gz /tmp/litestream.tar.gz
RUN tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf /tmp/litestream.tar.gz && rm /tmp/litestream.tar.gz
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
COPY litestream.yml /etc/litestream.yml
COPY start.sh ./
RUN chmod +x start.sh
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./start.sh"]
```

### File: `litestream.yml` — always the same

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: ${DB_PATH}
    replicas:
      - type: abs
        account-name: ${AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}
        account-key: ${AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY}
        bucket: ${AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER}
        path: db.sqlite
```

### File: `start.sh` — Node.js

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
litestream restore -if-replica-exists -config /etc/litestream.yml "${DB_PATH}"
exec litestream replicate -exec "node <start-file>" -config /etc/litestream.yml
```

### File: `start.sh` — Python

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
litestream restore -if-replica-exists -config /etc/litestream.yml "${DB_PATH}"
exec litestream replicate -exec "python <start-file>" -config /etc/litestream.yml
```

### App code contract

Remind the user their app must derive the DB path from env vars:

```js
// Node.js
const DB_PATH = process.env.DB_PATH || require("path").join(process.env.DATA_DIR || ".", "app.db");
```

```python
# Python
import os, pathlib
DB_PATH = os.environ.get("DB_PATH") or str(pathlib.Path(os.environ.get("DATA_DIR", ".")) / "app.db")
```

If the app hardcodes a DB path (e.g. `./data.db`), update it to use `DATA_DIR` before deploying.

### Re-deploy

1. Call `app_deploy` with just `folder` (the absolute path)
2. The tool reads `.deploy.json` and re-deploys automatically
3. Report the updated URL

### Error handling

- **"Not authenticated"** → Run the login flow (Step 1)
- **"slug already exists"** → Ask the user to choose a different app name
- **"Folder does not exist"** → Verify the path with the user

## Step 4: Delete an App

1. Ask the user which app to delete (by slug). If unsure, list apps first (Step 5)
2. Confirm with the user: "Are you sure you want to delete **{app_name}** ({slug})? This cannot be undone."
3. Call `app_delete` with `app_slug`
4. The tool removes the SWA, DNS record, and rebuilds the dashboard

The dashboard app (`apps` slug) cannot be deleted.

## Step 5: List Apps

1. Call `app_list` (no arguments)
2. Present the results as a readable list with name, slug, URL, and last deploy time
3. If no apps exist, tell the user

## Step 6: App Info

1. Call `app_info` with `app_slug`
2. Present: name, description, URL, status, last deploy time
3. If not found, suggest listing apps to find the correct slug

## Step 7: Update App Info

1. Call `app_update_info` with `app_slug` and the fields to change (`app_name` and/or `app_description`)
2. This updates the dashboard display only — it does NOT re-deploy the app code

## Step 8: Dashboard Rebuild

1. Call `dashboard_rebuild` (no arguments)
2. This regenerates the dashboard at `https://apps.env.fidoo.cloud` from current Azure state
3. Use this if the dashboard is out of sync

## Important Notes

- All apps are protected by Entra ID — only users with the `app_subscriber` role can access them
- The deploy tool automatically excludes sensitive files (.env, .git, node_modules, .pem, .key, etc.)
- App slugs are generated from the app name (lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens, max 60 chars)
- Each app gets a custom domain: `{slug}.env.fidoo.cloud`
- The dashboard at `apps.env.fidoo.cloud` is auto-rebuilt after every deploy, delete, or info update
